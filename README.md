Using Pytorch to build a predictive model for bankruptcy on the Polish Bankruptcy Dataset. 

# Introduction 

This is a showcase how we can use Pytorch and other related libraries to develop an end to end solution for predicting bankruptcy in companies. We make use of the Polish Bankruptcy Dataset (available here: (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data)) to train such a predictive model. What we demonstrate is how work within the framework of Pytorch to reduce boilerplate code and keep a clean code base throughout data loading, transformation, modelling to finally serving the model for consumption. While the are particularities related to this particular dataset, the techniques are general and we hope what is shown here can be adopted to your particular predictive modelling task. 

We will not be so much focused on data analytics as we are in building a predictive model based on machine learning techniques.
